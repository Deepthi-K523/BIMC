# BIMC -  We propose a drug repositioning computational approach based on the target microRNAs. The approach is able to predict the potential drug-disease associations along with the causal microRNAs.

Dataset
--
1. Associations - Contains Drug-microRNA and microRNA-Disease association matrices and corresponding data.
2.  Similarity Data –  Contains Drug, microRNA and disease pairwise similarities.
--
1. NamesToNumbrs.m  – Code to convert existing associations to numbers for generating association  
    matrix.
2. Association.m  –  Code to generate association matrix.
